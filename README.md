This tool relied on Python 2 which is no longer included with macOS.
I'm no longer managing printers this way so I'm unmotivated to rewrite and support the tool.
Thanks for using it over the years!

## Self Service Printer Installer

Present users with a GUI to install printers on their Mac via Self Service (with Magic‚Ñ¢)

![Demo GIF](https://haircut.keybase.pub/github/self-service-printer-installer/demo.gif)

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Warning: Batteries not included. Requires a good amount
of setup on _your_ end to save your users from the pit of despair.

This is a preliminary version of the tool which administrators at several organizations
are testing. Things may change and break quickly!
